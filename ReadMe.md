Certainly! Here's an updated version of the README file that includes code snippets for the Jenkins pipeline, application code, and Terraform configuration:

# Blogging Platform CI/CD

This repository contains the code and configuration for the Blogging Platform CI/CD pipeline, application code, and infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.

## Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline automates the continuous integration and continuous deployment process for the Blogging Platform application. It consists of the following stages:

1. **Clone**: This stage clones the source code repository for the Blogging Platform application.

```groovy
stage('Clone') {
    steps {
        git 'https://github.com/yourusername/blogging-platform.git'
    }
}
```

2. **Build**: This stage installs the required dependencies for the application.

```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        container('python') {
            sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Test**: This stage runs the unit tests for the application.

```groovy
stage('Test') {
    steps {
        container('python') {
            sh 'python -m unittest discover'
        }
    }
}
```

4. **Deploy**: This stage deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

```groovy
stage('Deploy') {
    environment {
        KUBECONFIG = credentials('kubeconfig')
        IMAGE = 'yourusername/blogging-app'
    }
    steps {
        container('kubectl') {
            sh 'kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG apply -f deployment.yaml'
            sh 'kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG apply -f service.yaml'
            sh "kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG set image deployment/blogging-app-deployment blogging-app-container=$IMAGE"
        }
    }
}
```

The Jenkins pipeline is configured to trigger automatically on every commit to the repository, ensuring that changes are built, tested, and deployed consistently.

## Blogging Platform Application

The Blogging Platform application is a web application built using Python. It provides a platform for users to create and publish blog posts. The application code can be found in the `blogging-platform` directory.

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x and ensure it is available in your system's `PATH`.
2. Navigate to the `blogging-platform` directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Start the application by running the command: `python app.py`.
5. Access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Terraform Infrastructure Provisioning

The Terraform configuration in this repository allows for provisioning the infrastructure required to host the Blogging Platform application on AWS.

The main Terraform files are as follows:

- `main.tf`: Defines the AWS provider and resources such as EC2 instances.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with your desired region
}

resource "aws_instance" "blogging_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789"  # Replace with the desired AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"        # Replace with the desired instance type
  key_name      = "your-keypair"    # Replace with your key pair name

  tags = {
    Name = "Blogging Instance"
  }

  # Add any additional configuration for the instance, such as security groups, subnet, etc.
}
```

- `variables.tf`: Defines input variables used in the Terraform configuration.

```hcl
variable "aws_access_key" {
  description = "AWS access key"
}

variable "aws_secret_key
